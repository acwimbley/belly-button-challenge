# belly-button-challenge

This is the most difficult subject and not understood by myself.  I had alot of help from the TAs,  tutor, which was not as helpful, and a fellow student.  I had to grasp that the functions needed to be created before calling or using the functions.  I was excited just to get the drop down to work.
